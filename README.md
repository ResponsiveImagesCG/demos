Avoid download of smaller media demo
=====

This is a branch showing how to avoid FOLRI using `min-device-width` or `max-device-width` 

The working demo is in  [http://medula.cl/temp/no-folri/](http://medula.cl/temp/no-folri/)

Note: Couldn't get the demo working with the css styles that came in the template, so I disabled them (seems to be something to do with the floats not letting the boxes expand properly).
